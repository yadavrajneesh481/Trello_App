How would your tables and apis change for the following scenarios. What tables and api endpoints would you add? Which tables and api endpoints would need to be updated?

1. If a user can create and edit stages for a particular board. For example instead of Open > In Progress > Done if they want the stages of their task board to be Read > Working > Reviewing > Completed

Answer = We can allow users with a edit functionality for each board. User can click on edit icon option present on top right corner of each board and change the title of the board.
   
2. If users can comment on tasks

 Answer =  For each task we can have a comment icon. On clicking the icon,  pop box for all the comments on the current task can appear on the screen. Users can add comments by clicking on 
           add icon of the comment box.

 3. How will you do error handling?

  Answer = We can enclose every functionality in try-catch block to look for the potential errors. We can raise custom errors wherever we think there is possibility of potential unexpected 
           behaviour.
